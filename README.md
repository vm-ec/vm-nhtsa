# vm-nhtsa
This repository contains a backend Java connector application designed to interface with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) systems. The application acts as a middleware or integration layer, enabling seamless communication between external systems and NHTSA's services or APIs.

Key Features:
API Integration:

Connects to NHTSA's public or private APIs to fetch or submit data related to vehicle safety, recalls, crash data, and more.
Supports RESTful API communication, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.
Data Processing:

Parses, processes, and transforms raw NHTSA data into a structured format for downstream applications.
Includes data validation and cleansing to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Scalability:

Built with scalability in mind, allowing for high-throughput data transactions and multiple concurrent API calls.
Utilizes efficient Java frameworks like Spring Boot for rapid development, dependency injection, and smooth scalability.
Security:

Implements secure communication protocols (HTTPS, OAuth2, API Keys) to safeguard data exchange.
Includes logging and auditing features to track API usage and detect anomalies.
Error Handling:

Robust error-handling mechanisms to retry failed requests or log errors for debugging purposes.
Graceful fallback options in case of API downtime or connectivity issues.
Configuration:

Offers customizable configurations for API endpoints, authentication credentials, and request parameters.
Includes support for environment-based configurations (e.g., development, staging, production).
Use Cases:

Vehicle manufacturers and safety organizations can use the app to fetch recall data.
Insurance companies can integrate it into their systems to analyze crash data.
Researchers and analysts can pull detailed reports for safety studies.
